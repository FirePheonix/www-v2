## Goals for This Week


- **Goal 1:** Basic UI for Image Upload/Real time Video upload and adjust.
- **Goal 2:** Putting the developed UIs onto the widget blocks.
- **Goal 3:** Searching for exisiting audios in the phrase maker and note blocks.

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Interface for Image upload for Lego Notations**  
   - Music Blocks has a feature to detect the color of pixels generated from drawing within the program, but it cannot detect the color of pixels from images that are either uploaded or from a webcam. 
   - This week I was travelled to a village, I didn't have no internet there, but worked on implementing the LegoBricks block ON TO the music blocks canvas.
   - You have to change a LOT (I had to go through 6 of them) of files in order to implement an entirely new block. (Good Part: A LOT OF THE CODE IS ALREADY THERE IN MUSIC BLOCKS. It's sooo beautifully encapsulated and documented.)

2. **Graphics for Lego Bricks**  
   - The following feature helps to use a real time video(webcam) onto the Lego Notation detection interface. Also, you may freely edit and move it around the canvas.

3. **Identified methods to exporting blocks' output as an action block**  
   - I read and went through a lot of documentation, saw a lot of code in the Phrase Maker widget that would help in exporting the code as:  midi and as action block.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Getting the UI on to the interface of music blocks itself was a challenge.
- **Solution:** Consulted my mentors, read the old documentation on "how to add new blocks", used some previous codes.

- **Challenge:** Figuring out how would the user workflow in the Lego Bricks block take place.
- **Solution:** Talked to my mentor on meet, discussed how exports take place in the phrase maker?

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained familiarity with **how outputs in different blocks take place.**.
- Deepened understanding of **inheritance, code modularity and custom return types**
- Improved skills in **exports, imports, code reusability**, **documentation**, and **collaboration workflows**.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Implement **mapping of musical notes to lego bricks' colors**.
- Target: Completing the **core implementation** in the week number 2 and 3.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Walter Bender's](https://github.com/walterbender) advise on how phrase maker exports the output as an ACTION block in the biweekly meet, I was able to figure out a way to return.
